It should be a device that assists you at any time. The device has a connected phone and has the same database. The device itself is in the shape of a pyramid with a built-in hologram system. Hardware - raspberry 4

Hologram will be glass-based as a pyramid. Screen on bottom of pyramid currently is not ready to present. 


sooo... some steps of our building:

    1) generating speech-to-text and text-to-speech

    2) build basis for machine (ruspberry pi 4) on python 

    3) in couple with 2. build android app that conect's 
    to our machine and has a little data-travel between

    4) connect chat-GPT (3 turbo or 4) API to our software 
    on machine (Biba-dev) and same methods with app (probably)
